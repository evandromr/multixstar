This is a rewrite of the functionality of [PVM_XSTAR](http://space.mit.edu/cxc/pvm_xstar/) with basic python libs.
It spawns multiple processes of `xstar` then converts them into an `mtable`.

TODO:
* Allow parameters to be passed by a file
* Make sure all flags are handled correctly

REQUIRES:
  * requires the `six` module for compatibility between python 2 and 3
  
  
  This is a modified fork of @nocturnalastro/mutlixstar
